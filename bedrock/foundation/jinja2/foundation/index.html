      The nonprofit Mozilla Foundation is the organizational home of the
      Mozilla Project, a global community and public interest initiative
      that believes the Web should be open and accessible to all. To
      protect the Web as a public resource and empower its users, we
      create open source products, teach 21st-century skills and spur
      grassroots advocacy campaigns. All this is made possible by
      full-time staff and thousands of volunteers around the world.

      To keep the Web accessible, we build products that create
      opportunity and inspire further innovation. Many of Mozilla’s
      products are developed by the Mozilla Corporation, a wholly-owned
      subsidiary of the Mozilla Foundation. The Mozilla Corporation
      functions as a self-sustaining social enterprise — money earned
      through its products is reinvested into the organization. Products
      include our flagship <a href="{{ firefox }}">Firefox browser</a>,
      <a href="{{ firefox_os }}">Firefox OS</a>, and other open source
      tools. The Mozilla Corporation also partners with like-minded allies
      to bring an open source ethos to industries and technologies like
      online video, telecommunications and virtual reality.

      Mozilla is also committed to empowering individuals online and
      unlocking opportunity through education. We believe in the importance
      of universal web literacy: creating a world where everyone can read,
      write and participate online. Most of our web literacy work is carried
      out by the Foundation and the Mozilla community directly. Our
      <a href="{{ hive }}">Hive Learning Networks</a> are robust educational
      communities in cities around the world, and
      <a href="{{ clubs }}">Mozilla Clubs</a> and
      <a href="{{ parties }}">Maker Parties</a> teach web literacy through
      hands-on and peer-to-peer learning. Our educational tools like the 
      <a href="{{ thimble }}">Thimble code editor</a> and
      <a href="{{ webmaker}}">Webmaker for Android</a> transform individuals
      from Web consumers into Web creators. And our leadership pipelines — 
      the <a href="{{ open_news }}">OpenNews</a>,
      <a href="{{open_web}}">Open Web</a> and
      <a href="{{ science }}">Mozilla Science</a> fellowship programs, and
      the <a href="{{ festival }}">annual Mozilla Festival</a> — cultivate
      bright minds and bring the values of the open Web into the sectors of
      journalism, public policy and science. As a nonprofit, much of
      Mozilla’s work in the education space is made possible through your
      donations and the efforts of volunteers.

      Mozilla also carries out <a href="{{ advocacy }}">advocacy work</a>.
      We defend the Web against companies and governments that seek to
      wrest control away from the public. Our advocacy work addresses
      issues like net neutrality, privacy and mass surveillance, and often
      requires effort from all corners of the Mozilla Project. Our grassroots
      campaigns stretch from the U.S. to India to Germany and beyond, but
      share a common goal: ensuring the Web remains free and open.
