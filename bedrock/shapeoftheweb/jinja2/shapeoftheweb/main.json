But sometimes this careful balance falls out of whack, such as when software companies are prevented from reusing existing code from others when all they want is ensure interoperability, or in other words, be certain their software will work with other software. If information is unnecessarily hindered, or if businesses are afraid to invest in new technologies, copyrights and patents are hurting more than they’re helping.",
